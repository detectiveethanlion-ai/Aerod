        <p>
            The common question that most people ask is "What is the term and law that defines how air makes a object
            move?". The answer to that question is Aerodynamics. Aerodynamics is the branch of physics that studies how
            air
            moves around objects like planes, helicopters, birds and even cars. These are some examples of how the air
            around us can
            affect certain objects:
        </p>
        <p>
            The air around a plane defines the plane's speed making it fast or slow. This same principle is applied to
            cars and boats too. The air around a bird or a paraglider can make them fly higher or lower. The air around
            a helicopter
            can cause turbluence which means the helicopter will shake and move around and it will be hard too control
            it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="aerod-principles">
        <h2 class="montserrat-title">How Aerodynamics work</h2>
        <p>
            Aerodynamics is applied to many things in our daily lives. The way cars and planes are shaped and why
            helicopters have two
            rotar blades is all because of Aerodynamics. It basically applies to anything that moves through air. The
            shape, size and
            surface of an object determine how air flows around it. For example, a sports car can go faster than a bus
            because of
            their shape and size. A bus has a flat surface on its front which makes it hard for air to flow around it
            but a sports car
            has a smooth shape which makes it easy for air to flow around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When an objects surface makes it hard for air to flow aroud it, it is called drag. Drag is the force that
            slows down an
            object. Drag can be reduced by making the object's surface smooth and round. When a object is causing less
            drag, it is
            called streamlined. Streamlined objects can move faster than non-streamlined objects because they reduce
            drag by allowing
            air to flow more smoothly around it. The diagram below shows how air flows smoothly around an aeroplane wing
            and a birds
            wing. This also shows an example of how streamlined objects look like and how is allows them to move faster.

        <h2 class="montserrat-title">The Math used in Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p>
            As Aerodynamics is a branch of physics, it uses math to calculate many properties of the object. These are
            Calculus,
            differential equations and linear algebra. Calculus is used to calculate the rates of change in the airflow
            like velocity
            and pressure. Differential equations are required to solve the fluid flow and are used to model airflow
            around objects.
            And finally, linear algebra is used to repersent forces, velocities and other aerodynamic properties. They
            are also used in
            solving systems of equations related to airflow and structural analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also Trigonometry which is used to calculate the angles of attack and altitude of a plane. This is
            a advanced
            level of math and is used to design and build planes as the amount of drag can increase or decrease
            depending on the
            altitude and the angle of attack. The diagram below shows how trigonometry is used in aerodynamics and how
            everything
            changes depending on the angle of attack.

        <h2 class="montserrat-title">The Forces of Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p>
            In Aerodynamics, there are 4 forces that act upon any object that move through the air and the diagram below
            shows their
            actions:

                <th>Gravity</th>
                <th>Thrust</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Lift is the force that makes an object go up and counteracts gravity. Lift is caused by the wind
                    interacting with
                    an object which creates pressure underneath the object which causes it to. Birds are natures example
                    of
                    Aerodynamics as they entirely rely on lift to fly. Aeroplanes also use lift to fly as fly they have
                    flaps on their
                    wings which directs the wind downwards and creates lift. Same thing with landing as the flaps are
                    used to direct
                    wind upwards which pushes the plane down.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Another way that planes land is using gravity. Gravity is the force that pulls everything down back
                    to the surface
                    of the earth. Gravity is caused by the Earth's mass and energy pulling everything towards it. That
                    is one of the
                    reasons why the moon orbits the earth. This also why birds and aeroplanes are designed to create a
                    lot of lift to
                    counteract gravity. But gravity also helps planes and birds land as gravity is pulling them back to
                    the ground.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Thrust is the force that propels a object forward. Thrust is generated by acellerating a mass of
                    fluid. This
                    acelleration is achieved by the engines of a plane which causes pressure to build up behind the
                    plane and pushes
                    it forward. On the other hand, birds cause thrust by flapping their wings which also builds up
                    pressure making
                    themselves move forward.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Drag is the force that counteracts thrust. Drag is caused by the wind interacting with an object
                    which effectively
                    slows it down. This is one of the reasons why the front of a plane (the nose) is streamlined so the
                    air can flow
                    smoothly to reduce drag. This is also one of the reasons why cheetahs are the fastest animal on land
                    as they have
                    a streamlined body unlike humans who have a flat chest which causes a lot of drag. This is why we
                    have to bend
                    down at the start of the race because it reduces drag at the start and propels us forward.

        <h2 class="montserrat-title">Hydrodynamics</h2>
        <p>
            Hydrodynamics is the same as Aerodynamics but it is applied to a object moving around liquids. The only
            difference between
            their properties is that liquids are much denser than air. This means that the forces of hydrodynamics are
            much stronger
            than the forces of aerodynamics. This is why most boats are much bigger than planes but the most important
            difference is
            the reason why boats (especially Submarines) do not have wings.

            Aeroplanes have wings because they need to create lift to counteract gravity but in the case of boats
            (specifically Submarines) the pressure is that causes lift is coming from below it. This is why boats do not
            have wings as
            it just increases drag and weight. Instead of needing wings to prevent a boat from sinking, a boat has a
            U-shaped hull
            which lowers the center of buoyancy below the ship and creates another force that is pushing the ship up,
            the force of
            buoyancy.
